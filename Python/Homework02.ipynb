We also know that becuase the radius of the circle is 1 the lengths of the sides of the smallest square that encloses the cicle must be 2. Making the area of the square 4. So if we generate many random points in the square we can find the amount of points that fall withing distance 1 of the point (0,0). We will tally up all of the points that have a distance within 1 of (0,0) to find the proportion of points that fall within the circle. By doing this we are only accounting for points that are located in quadrent 1 becasue we are not generating any negative values. So inorder to get the total estimated value of $\\pi$ we must multiply the proportion by 4 to account for all 4 quadrents of the unit cirle.
